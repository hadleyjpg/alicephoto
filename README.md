# Alice Joan Photography

This is a project created for the Code Louisville Javascript course. Alice Rodriguez is a New Jersey based photographer. I created this site to help display her work, pricing and allow potential clients to contact her about her services.

## Requrements Met

1. Countdown Timer - Calculate and display data based on an external factor
2. Instagram Feed - Retrieve data from an external API
3. Phone Number - Implement a regular expression (regex)
4. Contact Form Submit - Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file

## Instagram Feed

Access Token needed for Instagram to function is included in my submission email. Please insert into line 626 in instafeed.min.js to view feed correctly.

## Blog Links

Blog pages do not link to external pages. Will implement Wordpress into site in future so Alice can post herself.
